# hello-world
A place to store ideas, resources, share and discuss things with others. 
It's been many years since I have touched code outside of some powershell and working in command line on appliances and hardware. 
Hardware has been my focus but with everyone rushing to the cloud I am going to need to up my game. 
Broad breadth of knowledge, but shallow in some areas.
